In this class, I worked on different data structures such as Vectors, Linked Lists, Hash Tables, and Binary Search Trees. I had many different projects that we worked on during this class that involved organizing data into these different structures. Each project had coding that we would work on as well as pseudocode to increase our understanding of the structure of our code. Practice with pseudocode has improved my ability to plan coding projects to reduce the amount of intial refactoring and has helped in reducing the number of errors. Even well planned and organized projects will encounter errors that need to be fixed and represents a significant portion of time spent on any project. Learning the development process of planning, coding, testing, debugging, and refactoring will allow the software development process to run smoother.
